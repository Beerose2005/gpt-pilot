Pythagora uses Alembic for database migrations.

After changing any of the database models, create a new migration:

    alembic -c core/db/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "description"

Migrations are applied automatically when the application starts, but can also be
run manually with:

    alembic -c core/db/alembic.ini upgrade head
