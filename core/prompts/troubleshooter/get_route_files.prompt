This was added in June 2024, to improve the accuracy of user testing instructions.
We've noticed that the LLM would often times include incorrect URLs in the user testing
instructions, because it wasn't aware of the routes used in the application.
The solution was to add the entire content of all the files that have routes defined in
them, and this prompt selects those files.

#}
Your task is to identify all the files, from the above list, that have routes defined in them. Return just the file paths as a JSON list named "files", DO NOT return anything else. If there are no files with routes, return an empty list.
