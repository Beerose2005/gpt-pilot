For the implementation instructions defined below, create a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine.

~~~IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS~~~
{{ implementation_instructions }}
~~~END_OF_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS~~~

Each actionable step can be either:

* `command`
 - command to run
 - assume current working directory is project root folder, which means you MUST add `cd server && <cmd>` or `cd client && <cmd>` if they have to be executed inside `./server` or `./client` folders
 - must be able to run on a {{ os }} machine

* `save_file`
 - create or update ONE file (only provide file path, not contents)
 - **IMPORTANT**: If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

* `human_intervention`
 - if you need the human to do something other than coding or testing, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do
 - NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done
 - NEVER use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code
 - **IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.
