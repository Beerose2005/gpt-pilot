Ok, great. Now, you need to take the epic #{{ epic_number }} "{{ epic_description }}" and break it down into smaller tasks. Each task is one testable whole that the user can test and commit. Each task will be one commit that has to be testable by a human. Return the list of tasks for the Epic #{{ epic_number }}. For each task, write the the task description and a description of how a human should test if the task is successfully implemented or not. Keep in mind that there can be 1 task or multiple, depending on the complexity of the epic. The epics will be implemented one by one so make sure that the user needs to be able to test each task you write - for example, if something will be implemented in the epics after the epic #{{ epic_number }}, then you cannot write it here because the user won't be able to test it.
