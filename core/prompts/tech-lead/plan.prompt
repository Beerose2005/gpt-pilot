You are working in a software development agency and a project manager and software architect approach you telling you that you're assigned to {% if task_type  == 'feature' %}add new feature to an existing project{% else %}work on a new project{% endif %}.
You are working on an app called "{{ state.branch.project.name }}" and you need to create a detailed development plan so that developers can start developing the app.

{% include "partials/project_details.prompt" %}
{% include "partials/features_list.prompt" %}
{% if existing_summary %}

The developers have already used a project scaffolding tool that creates the initial boilerplate for the project:
{{ existing_summary }}
{% endif %}

{% include "partials/files_list.prompt" %}

{% if task_type  == 'feature' %}
Finally, here is the description of new feature that needs to be added to the app "{{ state.branch.project.name }}":
```
{{ epic.description }}
```
{% endif %}

{% if epic.complexity and epic.complexity == 'simple' %}
This is very low complexity {{ task_type }} and because of that, you have to create ONLY one task that is sufficient to fully implement it.
{% else %}
Before we go into the coding part, your job is to split the development process of creating this app into smaller epics.
Now, based on the project details provided{% if task_type  == 'feature' %} and new feature description{% endif %}, think epic by epic and create the entire development plan{% if task_type  == 'feature' %} for new feature{% elif task_type  == 'app' %}. {% if state.files %}Continue from the existing code listed above{% else %}Start from the project setup{% endif %} and specify each epic until the moment when the entire app should be fully working{% if state.files %}. You should not reimplement what's already done - just continue from the implementation already there{% endif %}{% endif %} while strictly following these rules:

{% include "partials/project_tasks.prompt" %}
{% endif %}
