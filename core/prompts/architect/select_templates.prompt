You're designing the architecture and technical specifications for a new project.

To speed up the project development, you need to consider if you should use a project template or start from scratch. If you decide to use a template, you should choose the one that best fits the project requirements.

Here is a high level description of "{{ state.branch.project.name }}":
```
{{ state.specification.description }}
```

You have an option to use project templates that implement standard boilerplate/scaffolding so you can start faster and be more productive. To be considered, a template must be compatible with the project requirements (it doesn't need to implement everything that will be used in the project, just a useful subset of needed technologies). You should pick one template that's the best match for this project.

If no project templates are a good match, don't pick any! It's better to start from scratch than to use a template that is not a good fit for the project and then spend time reworking it to fit the requirements.

Here are the available project templates:
{% for template in templates.values() %}
### {{ template.name }} ({{ template.stack }})
{{ template.description }}

Contains:
{{ template.summary }}
{% endfor %}

Output your response in a valid JSON format like in this example:
```json
{
    "architecture": "Detailed description of the architecture of the application",
    "template": "foo" // or null if you decide not to use a project template
}
```
