{{ file_content }}

I have external documentation in Swagger Open API format.
Create a comma separated list of short words topics of the description of the file so that I can search for the relevant parts of the documentation.
Use up to 5 words max.
If the file does not need external API documentation, just return "None" and nothing else, no explanation needed.
