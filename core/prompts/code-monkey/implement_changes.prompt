You are working on a project and your job is to implement new code changes based on given instructions.
Now you have to implement ALL changes that are related to `{{ file_name }}` described in development instructions listed below.
Make sure you don't make any mistakes, especially ones that could affect rest of project. Your changes will be reviewed by very detailed reviewer. Because of that, it is extremely important that you are STRICTLY following ALL the following rules while implementing changes:

{% include "partials/coding_rules.prompt" %}

You are currently working on this task:
```
{{ state.current_task.description }}
```

{% include "partials/user_feedback.prompt" %}

Here are development instructions and now you have to focus only on changes in `{{ file_name }}`:
---start_of_development_instructions---

{{ instructions }}

---end_of_development_instructions---

{% if rework_feedback is defined %}
You previously made changes to file `{{ file_name }}` but not all changes were accepted, and the reviewer provided feedback on the changes that you must rework:
{{ rework_feedback}}
Please update the file accordingly and output the full new version of the file.

The reviewer accepted some of your changes, and the file now looks like this:
```
{{ file_content }}
```
{% elif file_content %}
Here is how `{{ file_name }}` looks like currently:
```
{{ file_content }}
```
{% else %}
You need to create a new file `{{ file_name }}`.
{% endif %}

{% include "partials/files_list.prompt" %}
