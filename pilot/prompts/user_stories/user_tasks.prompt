Break these stories into user tasks that a user needs to do to interact with the app. In the example description (`Create a script that finds Youtube channels with the word "test" inside the channel name`), user tasks could be:
- `user runs the CLI command in which he specifies the keyword youtube channel needs to contain and the location where the CSV file should be saved`


**IMPORTANT**
Return one user task at a time. Do not return anything other than a single user task. I might ask you to modify some user tasks. Only when I send you an empty response, you can move to the next user task.

**IMPORTANT**
Once you are done creating all user tasks, write a response containing nothing other than:
{{END_RESPONSE}}
