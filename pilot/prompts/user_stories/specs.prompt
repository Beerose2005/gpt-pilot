I want you to create {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}") that can be described as follows:
```
{{ prompt }}
```

Think step by step about the description for the {{ app_type }} "{{ name }}" and the provided questions and answers and create a list of all user stories. A user story is a description of how a user can interact with the {{ app_type }}. For example, if an app's description is `Create a script that finds Youtube channels with the word "test" inside the channel name`, user stories could be:
- `user runs the script from the CLI`
- `user gets the list of returned channels in a CSV file`

**IMPORTANT**
Output one user story at a time. Return nothing other than a single user story. I might ask you to modify some user stories. Only when I send you an empty response you can move to the next user story.

**IMPORTANT**
Once you are done creating all user stories, write a response containing nothing other than:
{{END_RESPONSE}}
