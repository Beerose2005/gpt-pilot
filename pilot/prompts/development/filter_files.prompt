You are working on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}", writing the code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "{{ name }}":
```
{{ app_summary }}
```
{{ features_list }}

{% if development_tasks and current_task %}
Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```{% for task in development_tasks %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ task['description'] }}
{% endfor %}
```
You are currently working on task "{{ current_task.description }}" and you have to focus only on that task.

{% endif %}
A part of the app is already finished.

The app currently contains the following files:
{% for fpath, summary in file_summaries.items() %}
* `{{ fpath }}`: {{ summary }}{% endfor %}

{% if user_feedback %}User who was using the app "{{ name }}" sent you this feedback:
```
{{ user_feedback }}
```
{% endif %}{% if next_solution_to_try %}
Focus on solving this issue in the following way:
```
{{ next_solution_to_try }}
```
{% endif %}
Now, before you can work on this, you need to select which files from the above list are relevant to this task. Output the relevant files in a JSON list.
