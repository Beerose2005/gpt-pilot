You are working on an {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}". To give you a better idea of what you are working on, here is a description of the {{ app_type }}:
```
{{ app_summary }}
```

Development plan for that {{ task_source }} was created and the {{ task_source }} was then broken down to smaller tasks so that it's easier for development.

Here are tasks that are finished so far:
```{% for task in finished_tasks %}
- Task #{{ loop.index }}
Description: {{ task }}

{% endfor %}```

Here are tasks that still have to be implemented:
```{% for task in not_finished_tasks %}
- Task #{{ finished|length + loop.index }}
Description: {{ task }}

{% endfor %}```

This is the last task you were working on:
```
{{ last_finished_task['description'] }}
```
While working on that last task, you were iterating based on user feedbacks for this {{ task_source }}. Here is list of all iterations:
```{% for iteration in llm_solutions %}
- Iteration #{{ loop.index }}:

User feedback: {{ iteration['user_feedback'] }}
Developer solution: {{ iteration['llm_proposal'] }}
{% endfor %}```

{{ custom_files_list }}

You need to think step by step what was done in last task and update development plan if needed. All iterations that were mentioned were executed and finished successfully and that needs to be reflected in updated development plan.
As output you have to give 2 things:
1. Reword/update current task, "updated_current_task", if needed, based on what is implemented so far. Consider current task description, all iterations that were implemented during this task and all changes that were made to the code.

2. Give me updated list of tasks that still have to be implemented. Take into consideration all tasks in current development plan, previous tasks that were finished and everything that was implemented in this task. There should be minimum possible number of tasks that still have to be executed to finish the app. You must list only tasks that need implementation and were not done in scope of previous tasks or during iterations on current task.
